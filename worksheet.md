# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:
  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:
  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
GitHub is a code hosting platform that allows for users to store code and collaborate with other developers, BitBucket is a similar type of web-based hosting platform and is also mainly used to collaborate with other users. They vary based on the integration preferences and existing toolsets, thus the "better" one depends on the user. In terms of number of users, GitHub is the more popular platform.

Jon Mountjoy on 11/08/2014
 
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
The first commit was made on 25/06/2010 by Dave Pearce and the last commit was made on 11/08/2022 by Dave Pearce

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
